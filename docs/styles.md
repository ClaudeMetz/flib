FLib includes several GUI styles for your use and convenience. For help and information on how to use these styles effectively, refer to the [work-in-progress GUI style guide](https://github.com/raiguard/Factorio-SmallMods/wiki/GUI-Style-Guide).

**IMPORTANT:** Modifying these styles in any way will modify them for all mods using them. Therefore, unless you are specifically creating a GUI skin mod, **DO NOT MODIFY THESE STYLES!** Instead, create your own new styles using these styles as parents, then modify those new styles as you wish.

### Button styles

**flib_selected_frame_action_button**

A "selected" frame action button. Use when a frame action button can "toggle" on and off.

**flib_selected_tool_button**

A "selected" tool button. Use when a tool button can "toggle" on and off.

#### Slot styles

FLib includes a myriad of colored slot styles for use with `sprite-button`s:

There are three categories of style, from top to bottom: `slot`, `slot_button`, and `standalone_slot_button`. From left to right, the colors are `default`, `white`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `cyan`, `blue`, `purple`, and `pink`.

The styles are formatted as `flib_CATEGORY_COLOR`. For example, if I want a pink standalone slot button (bottom-right on the preview image), I would use `flib_standalone_slot_button_pink`.

Each slot style also has a `selected` variant, which uses the hovered graphics as default. This is intended to let a user "select" a button, and to let the mod visually distinguish it from other buttons around it. To use these styles, replace `flib_` with `flib_selected_` in the style you wish to use (e.g. `flib_selected_slot_button_green`).

### Empty widget styles

**flib_dialog_footer_drag_handle**

A drag handle suitable for placement in the footer of a **dialog** window.

**flib_dialog_titlebar_drag_handle**

A drag handle suitable for placement in the titlebar of a **dialog** window.

**flib_horizontal_pusher**

An invisible element that has `horizontally_stretchable` set, thereby "pushing" everything to the right.

**flib_titlebar_drag_handle**

A drag handle suitable for placement in the titlebar of a **standard** window (a window with a close button, or any other frame action buttons in the titlebar).

**flib_vertical_pusher**

An invisible element that has `vertically_stretchable` set, thereby "pushing" everything to the bottom.

### Scroll pane styles

**flib_naked_scroll_pane**

A marginless scroll pane for use inside of content panes. When activated, it draws a shadow around its edges to give a more "inset" effect, to make it more obviously scrollable. The content is given an automatic 12px padding.

**flib_naked_scroll_pane_under_tabs**

Identical to `flib_naked_scroll_pane`, but has an inset on the top side when activated. Designed for use inside of a `tabbed_pane_with_no_side_padding` when not using a toolbar.

**flib_naked_scroll_pane_no_padding**

Identical to `flib_naked_scroll_pane`, but has no padding for the content that's put inside. Useful for wrapping a table in a scroll pane, for example.
